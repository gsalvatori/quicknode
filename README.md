quicknode
---

A tiny library to use dictionaries in C language using BST (Binary Search Tree).


why use binary search trees
---

Because it's **fast**. You can search, delete and insert nodes in O(log n), rather than using sorted arrays that takes O(n) time to run insert and remove functions.

```bash
cd quicknode
```

```bash
